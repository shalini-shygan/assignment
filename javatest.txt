regarding the practical difference between HashMap and Hashtable, here are a few key points:

Synchronization: Hashtable is synchronized, which means it's thread-safe and can be accessed by multiple threads concurrently without any issues. On the other hand, HashMap is not synchronized by default, which means it's not thread-safe. However, you can make it synchronized by using Collections.synchronizedMap() method to wrap it.
Null values: Hashtable does not allow null keys or values. If you try to put a null key or value into a Hashtable, it will throw a NullPointerException. On the other hand, HashMap allows null keys and values.
Iteration: Hashtable is slower than HashMap when it comes to iterating over its elements because of its synchronized nature. In contrast, HashMap is faster because it's not synchronized.
Enumeration: Hashtable has a method called elements() that returns an enumeration of the values in the Hashtable. HashMap does not have an equivalentÂ method.
